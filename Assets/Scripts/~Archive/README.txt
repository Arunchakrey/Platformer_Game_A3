ARCHIVE FOLDER
===============

This folder contains old/archived scripts that were causing compilation errors.

All .cs files have been deleted to prevent Unity from compiling duplicate classes.

The .meta files remain for reference, but the actual scripts are gone.

If you need to recover any of these files, check your git history:
- PlayerInventory.cs
- PlayerDeathHandler.cs
- PlayerMovementL4.cs
- And other archived scripts

Folder was renamed to ~Archive (with tilde) so Unity ignores it by default.
