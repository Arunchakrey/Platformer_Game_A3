# **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Platformer Game**

## Overview

This project is a 2D/3D hybrid platformer game developed in Unity as part of a group assignment. The game explores sustainable development themes through interactive levels that test player reflexes and decision-making while maintaining an engaging visual and audio experience.

The project demonstrates our understanding of Unity‚Äôs physics, UI systems, sound design, and game logic, implemented collaboratively through version control on GitHub.
